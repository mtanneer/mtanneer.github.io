      Latex is beautiful. It allows one to create incredible documents while not having to worry about
      formatting. Unlike modern document editors, Latex is a typesetting program, 
      formating the content for you.

     <a href="https://www.overleaf.com/">Overleaf</a> Online Latex Editor in my opinion is the best place to start. As someone who uses Latex on a regular basis,
     this is suffucient for even full blown projects as well.

     The first thing is to create an account on overleaf, so all your work gets saved. There's various
     ways to save, but overleaf also uses cloud services to save the files for you. Register <a href="https://www.overleaf.com/register">here</a>.
